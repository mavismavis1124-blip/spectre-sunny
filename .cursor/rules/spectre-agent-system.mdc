# Main Project Reference

**Primary spec**: `docs/SPECTRE_AGENT_SYSTEM.md`

Use this document as the main reference for the Spectre Vibe project. It defines:

- **Mission** – Spectre AI market intelligence platform (crypto & stocks)
- **Agent modes** – Orchestrator, Frontend, UX, Creative Director, Backend, Platform, Security, Blockchain
- **Activation** – Switch mode by task (e.g. "build component" → Frontend; "design" → UX; "API" → Backend)
- **Design system** – SPECTRE AESTHETIC (glassmorphism, dark mode, color palette, typography, motion)
- **Architecture** – Orchestrator pattern; no direct API fetch from components; channel naming
- **Pages & features** – Dashboard, Screener, Token Detail, Social, Portfolio, Marketplace
- **Execution** – Identify scope → Plan (Orchestrator) → Execute (specialist) → Verify → Document

When planning or implementing, read `docs/SPECTRE_AGENT_SYSTEM.md` for full details. Follow its agent protocol and design system.
